<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
                 <P>This Python program demonstrates the use of if-else statements by presenting a simple quiz question to the user and providing feedback based on the user's response. The program follows a straightforward structure: it asks the user a question, processes the answer, and then gives feedback indicating whether the answer was correct or incorrect.</P>
<h1>IF-ELSE STATEMENT</h1>
                 <P>The if-else statement is a fundamental control structure in Python that allows for conditional execution of code blocks. It enables the program to make decisions and execute different actions based on specific conditions.</P>
<h1>SYNTAX</h1>           
              <H3>if condition:</H3>
              <H3># Code block to execute if the condition is true</H3>
              <H3>else:</H3>
              <H3># Code block to execute if the condition is false</H3>
<H1>CONCLUSION</H1>              
                 <P>This Python program effectively demonstrates the practical application of if-else statements by engaging the user in a simple interactive quiz.</P>
